## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the application of four different machine learning techniques—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM)—to classify tumor cells in the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset as either malignant or benign. Each model was rigorously tested and optimized, leading to high levels of accuracy and precision across the board.

### Model Preformance
**Random Forest**
* Accuracy: 0.9298
* Precision: 0.9000

**XGBoost**
* Accuracy: 0.9474
* Precision: 0.9250

**Logistic Regression**
* Accuracy: 0.9737
* Precision: 0.9744

**Support Vector Machine**
* Accuracy: 0.9737
* Precision: 0.9744


### Conclusion and Future Work
All models demonstrated strong performance in classifying breast cancer tumors, with Logistic Regression and SVM standing out due to their high accuracy and precision. This indicates that both linear and non-linear approaches can be highly effective for this dataset.

**Future Work**
* Further tuning of hyperparameters to possibly improve the Random Forest and XGBoost models.
* Exploring additional machine learning techniques such as neural networks.
* Conducting feature selection to streamline models and improve interpretability.
* Testing the models on other similar datasets to validate their generalizability.

Overall, this project highlights the importance of choosing the right machine learning model for the task at hand and the value of thorough model evaluation and comparison.
